 * A credential a human issues to their own agent.
 *
 * The question this answers is who is borrowing. Float extends credit to a
 * World-verified human, and an agent spending that line is the whole product -
 * so the agent does not need to consent to anything. The human already did,
 * when they verified and opened the facility. What was missing was any way for
 * an agent running outside the browser to *prove* which human sent it.
 *
 * That is this: a signed bearer token carrying the human's nullifier and a
 * spending cap they chose. It is the card, and issuing it is the authorisation.
 * The agent then spends within a mandate rather than asking permission per
 * purchase, and the party that agreed and the party that owes are the same
 * person again.
 *
 * Signed with the same secret as the session cookie, but stamped with its own
 * type so neither can be replayed as the other - a stolen session cookie must
 * not become a long-lived spending credential.
