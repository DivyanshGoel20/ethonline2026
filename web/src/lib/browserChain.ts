/**
 * Getting the browser wallet onto Arc before it is asked to spend.
 *
 * A wallet sends on whatever chain it happens to be showing. The repay flow
 * asked for accounts and then sent, with nothing in between, so a wallet parked
 * on Base signed a Base transaction to Float's treasury address - an address
 * that exists on every EVM chain, so there is no bounce and no error. Real
 * funds left, on a chain nothing in Float is watching, and the repayment was
 * recorded anyway because the send had returned a hash.
 *
 * Switching first turns a silent wrong-chain payment into a prompt the person
 * can read. On Arc, USDC is the native currency at 18 decimals rather than an
 * ERC-20, which is why a repayment here is a plain value transfer.
