/**
 * Nanopayments waiting to be written to the facility.
 *
 * An x402 charge is a cent. Recording it on chain costs more than a cent in
 * gas, so recording each one individually means the ledger costs more than the
 * payments it is tracking. Payments accumulate here and settle as one drawdown
 * row carrying a payment count.
 *
 * Two properties this file has to hold:
 *
 * Durability. A payment has already left Float's Gateway balance by the time it
 * lands here, so losing an entry means losing the debt. Entries are persisted
 * before the payment is reported as successful, never after.
 *
 * Exactly-once flushing. An entry is claimed before the chain write is awaited,
 * so a crash mid-flush leaves it claimed rather than unflushed - visible to be
 * reconciled, rather than silently booked twice.
